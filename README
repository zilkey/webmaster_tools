= Webmaster Tools

WebmasterTools is a plugin that covers helps webmasters manage their sites with major search engines more easily.  It is comprised of 3 parts:

* WebmasterVerification - Manage your HTML verification with a simple YAML file
* Sitemaps - Generate valid XML sitemaps for your models, and add your own static sitemaps
* GoogleSitemapGenerator - Use a rake task to use the google_sitemap_gen tool to generate xml sitemaps for static files

== WebmasterVerification

This plugin adds support for Google, Yahoo! and Live webmaster tool authorization 
for multiple webmasters.

Google, Yahoo! and Live (MSN) all have online tools for webmasters.  Each
site requires that users verify ownership by either adding meta tags to
pages on the site or upload specially-named HTML files.  For more information, see:

* https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/
* https://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/
* http://webmaster.live.com/

Before this plugin there were 2 ways to add files to your site: add custom routes
or keep the files in the public directory.  Whenever a new webmaster needs
authorization, you would add a route or add a physical html file.

Adding routes was simple and easy, but every time you updated the app you needed
to restart the server.  Adding files didn't require a server restart, but added
a lots of ugly files to the app.

This plugin allows you to add users by adding an entry to a config file so 
you don't have to store physical files, and you don't have to add routes or
restart the server (the yaml config is not cached).

== Installation

Via git:

  git clone git://github.com/zilkey/webmaster_tools.git vendor/plugins/webmaster_tools

Once it's installed run:

  script/generate webmaster_verification
  
The generator 

* creates a file named config/webmaster_verification.yml
* adds a "map.webmaster_verification" to config/routes.rb

To create a sitemap for a model, just add:

  class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    sitemappable
  end

=== config/webmaster_verification.yml

You can add several different users to each service,
or no users at all, and the names don't have to be the
same from one browser to the next - they are just there
to make it easy to identify who owns what.

To make it easier, you can also specify people's email
addresses.

When you make changes to this file, you do not need to 
restart the server

A sample file might look like:

  google:
    example@example.com: google121212.html
    edna: google131415.html
    betty: google3435365.html
  yahoo.com:
    eugene:
      filename: y_key_185746.html
      content: 098374
    edna:
      filename: y_key_185746.html
      content: 323454
  live:
    edna: 6565656564734839

=== map.webmaster_verification

map.webmaster_verification takes all of the entries in the config file and
turns them into routes for Google and Yahoo! and installs the route to
the Live xml file.

The route, once installed, looks like:

  ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
    map.webmaster_verification
  end

Once installed, and you've put entries into routes.rb, run

  rake routes
  
and you will notice routes that look like:

  /google5e12de32b7292ab0.html     {:controller=>"zilkey/routing/webmaster_verification", :action=>"standard"}
  /y_key_7c13d2bfdaa79c25.html     {:controller=>"zilkey/routing/webmaster_verification", :action=>"standard", :content=>"111e174241ecc5e0"}
  /LiveSearchSiteAuth.xml          {:format=>"xml", :controller=>"zilkey/routing/webmaster_verification", :action=>"live"}

=== WebmasterVerificationController

Behind the scenes, the routes map to a controller named Zilkey::Routing::WebmasterVerification

This controller renders the content directly, and does not modify view paths

== Sitemaps

There are 3 kinds of sitemaps:

* Sitemap index file (lists all other site maps)
* Sitemap file dynamically created for a model
* Custom sitemap you created

To include a model in the sitemap, just add "sitemappable"

  class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    sitemappable
  end

To add a custom sitemap, add a file to config/initializers named webmaster_verification.rb and include them.  Let's say you wanted to define a new custom sitemap that lived in public/static_sitemap.xml, you would add:

  WebmasterTools::Sitemaps::Defaults.host = case RAILS_ENV
  when "production": "example.com"
  else "localhost:3033"
  end

You can configure defaults on 2 levels - globally and per-model.  In addition, you can override the defaults for any given record.

  WebmasterTools::Sitemaps::Defaults.lastmod_field = "updated_at"
  WebmasterTools::Sitemaps::Defaults.priority = "0.7"
  WebmasterTools::Sitemaps::Defaults.changefreq = "weekly"
  WebmasterTools::Sitemaps::Defaults.protocol = "http://"
  WebmasterTools::Sitemaps.add(:path => "/static_sitemap.xml", :lastmod =>  File::Stat.new(File.join(RAILS_ROOT,"public","static_sitemap.xml")).mtime )

To enable sitemaps, configure your routes.rb to look like this:

  ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
    map.xml_sitemap
    etc...
  end

=== Disclaimers for Sitemaps

No caching occurs in any part of this process - every time Google, Yahoo! or Live request the page, the config file is loaded from disk, and the controller renders the response.

Adding urls to models is really a hack.  If I were slicker, I'd find a way to tie this into routing, or at least action_controller.

== google_sitemap_gen

  rake webmaster_tools:google_sitemap_gen
  
Looks in the config/webmaster_tools directory for a file named #{RAILS_ENV}.rb - so development.rb if you run it in development mode.

Copy the sitemap xml file from the plugin's google_sitemap_gen directory.  This is useful if you also have static files somewhere in your site.

== Acknowledgments

Part of this plugin was based on (read "shamelessly-stolen-from") the Jamis Buck's excellent series on routing at http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/10/20/monkey-patching-rails-extending-routes-1

== TODO

* Add sitemap index support and individual sitemap routes
* Add 50000 page limit to every model
* Update docs to be more instructive about what happens behind the scenes
* Use polymorphic_url and url_for to generate links and take a lot of complexity out of the app and the Node architecture
